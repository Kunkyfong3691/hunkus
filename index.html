  It is with a solemn heart that I must announce that our dear friend Derek has decided to stay in Shanghai, and leave the US. <br><br>
  As you may know, Derek has set on to Shanghai on an Archaeological expedition to discover whether aliens did in fact build the pyramids. For the question has been, and will always remain, how did the Ancient Egyptians construct the Pyramids without the use of renowned architect Frank Llyod Wright. 
  <br><br>To this end, the question remains unanswered, however, Derek has hopes that a new discovery may shed light on this troubling problem. With the use of new DNA infrared bio luminescent laserbeam technology he hopes to uncover the past, and reveal light on one of life’s most well kept secrets.
  <br><br>God’s speed Derek!

Congratulations Riley Barett, and thank you stat cast for informing us of this historic event.
